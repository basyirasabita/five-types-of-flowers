# Five Types of Flowers Classification üíê

This project is a basic computer vision project using CNN sequential model to classify image into [five types of flowers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kausthubkannan/5-flower-types-classification-dataset): Lily, Lotus, Orchid, Sunflower, and Tulip. The process included in this project consists of:  
1. **Introduction**  
Objectives of this project.
2. **Basic Exploratory Data Analysis**  
Exploration of the data including label proportion, image sizes and dimensions distribution, and displaying the images.
3. **Feature Engineering**  
Split the data and generate the image array by Image Data Generator.
4. **ANN Training: Model Definition, Training, and Evaluation**  
Building base sequential CNN model using tensorflow keras. Metrics used is accuracy. Evaluation consists of train and validation accuracy and loss plot, confusion matrix, and classification report.
5. **ANN Improvement: Model Definition, Training, and Evaluation**
Improving base sequential CNN model by augmenting the train data and adding batch normalization and dropout layers. Metrics used is accuracy. Evaluation consists of train and validation accuracy and loss plot, confusion matrix, and classification report.
6. **Conclusion**  
EDA and model conclusion.
7. **Model Inference**  
Predicting inference data using the best model.
8. **Model Deployment**  
All necessary files for model deployment using _Streamlit_ and [_HuggingFace_](https://huggingface.co/spaces/basyirasabita/five-types-flower-classification).
